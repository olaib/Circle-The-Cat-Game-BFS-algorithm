                          ABOUT THE GAME: Circle The Cat
                          ==============================
          is a puzzle game where you draw circles around a cat in an attempt to trap it. 
          Click the dots and stop the cat from escaping!
          ===============================================
          How to Play:
          Click the circles to create a barrier. Capturing the cat can be quite tricky. 
          It’s best to start from further away from the cat, because if you build too close,
          that cat will always find a way to squeeze past!

          When you’ve figured it out and built a fairly wide, closed perimeter, you must then fill it
          with circles until the cat has no circles to jump to. At this point, you’ve circled the cat,
          and the game starts again.
